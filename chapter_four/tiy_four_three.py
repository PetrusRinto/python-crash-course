# A for loop that append the numbers 1 to 20 in the numbers' list.
numbers = []
for num in range(1, 21):
    numbers.append(num)

# A variable associated with the appended numbers-list for the counting.
counting = numbers

# A for loop that counts the numbers' list inclusively.
for count in counting:
    print(count)

# Upon this commit I realized this overcomplication at my end.
# I got carried away with my new obtained knowledge from the course
# and ended up with more line of code than necessary.
# I decided to keep it though.
# That is because when I am done with this book,
# I want it to compare and notice my improvements.
