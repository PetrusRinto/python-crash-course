# 4-14 Look through the original PEP 8
# PEP 8: «https://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008»

# Did not start reading until now - 01.10.2025.

# Introduction - Reflection
# The PEP 8 document gives coding conventions for Python code.
# Setting a convention for the Python language.
# Convention means a standard for how something is or should be done.

# Guido van Rossum and Barry Warsaw are the authors.
# -Note-To-Self I want to know more about them as I read through this.
# The author's name 'Guido' is both ironic and hilarious - Respectfully.
# This is because it reminds me of the word 'guide' which PEP 8 is.

# The introduction gives a brief background and inspirations for PEP 8.
# It was adapted from Guido's 'Python Style Guide essay', and Barry's.
# Today's standard will probably change over time and become outdated.
# This is because the guide evolves as new conventions comes to light.

# A pattern I'd like to call 'Pyramid of Consistancy':
#     Top (Important, but less)
#         - Style guide
#         - Project
#         - Module or Function
#     Buttom (Most important)

# When breaking the rules are allowed:
#     1. The code become less readable, even for a PEP practitioner.
#     2. To keep consitency within a project. (ref the above Pyramid).
#     3. If the code in question only predates the introduction.
#     4. Rollback for compatibility.

# 07.10.2025
# I finished reading it 03.10.2025.
# The guide is not as relevant to me yet.
# Therefore I will finish the notes later.
